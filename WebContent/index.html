<h1>Read: How-to-use</h1>
Users can register by clicking the Register link on the Index page.
<br />
Users can logout on the home page.

After logging in Users can perform both driver and passenger functions. Passengers can request offers. They can also update/delete a request.
Finally they can view offers by clicking on the link that says offer for a ride. They have to enter in exactly what is in the given offer into the input boxes otherwise it won't insert into table(done by if statements).
If everything is entered correctly then they will be greeted by a rate screen where they can rate the driver.
<br />
Drivers can add cars (which is important if they want to be a well-behaved user). Driver can submit offers. 
They also can see possible matches(derived from offers and passenger requests). If they like a match then they can enter into the input boxes (as is in the table above) to give an offer directly to a passenger.
They can also update/delete submitted rides or delete a direct offer. They can also rate a passenger but through if statements I made it so that they can only rate passengers they have driven.
They can also see their allocated income ratio by clicking the link. The allocated income ratio is the rides they've given divided by the total rides given by the userbase.
<br />
In general options users can find their statistics, change every detail(except their username for primary key reasons),
view a leaderboard table, view/send messages, and look at comments on all the users.
<br />
By default: driver ratings are 0 and passenger ratings are 5.
<br />
At the bottom of the homepage is advertisment(s).
<br />
Admin clicks login on the index page. The login info is this: Username: admin password:admin.
After that admins can create support staff accounts and run queries.
<br />
Support staff can login after clicking the last link on the index page. They can create ads, 
track ads, reset passwords, view mis-behaved users, and lock out users.
